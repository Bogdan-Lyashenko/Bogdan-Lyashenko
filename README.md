### Hi there 👋

My name is [Bohdan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bohdan-liashenko-bb365854) and reading source code is my hobby and passion.
<br />
<br />
Few years ago I decided to learn React source code. It took quite some time, but as a result I published the open-source book
[“Under the hood ReactJs”](https://github.com/Bogdan-Lyashenko/Under-the-hood-ReactJS) which explains entire codebase with flowcharts.
<br />
<br />
First thing I realised after that I need some tool to generate flow chart images from JavaScript code. So a year later I built an open-source tool for that called
[“js2flowchart”](https://github.com/Bogdan-Lyashenko/js-code-to-svg-flowchart) which automatically generates flowcharts from JavaScript code.
<br />
<br />
Later, I discovered I still need something broader to cover entire codebase, something that can help marking important places in code, connections between files, etc. That's why I built “codecrumbs” (name is derived from “code” and “breadcrumb”). You can check
out [open-source version on Github](https://github.com/Bogdan-Lyashenko/codecrumbs).
<br />
<br />
While keep adding more features and learning more about the topic I got the vision that
just a "library" won't solve it, it's time to step up the game and build an application
with more systematic approach!

🔭  So currently I’m working on [Codecrumbs v2](https://codecrumbs.io), which standalone application with many cool features! Check out [project here](https://codecrumbs.io).
